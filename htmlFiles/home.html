            I can't thank the physical therapists at Rehoboth enough for their dedication to my recovery. After a sports injury, they designed a rehabilitation plan that not only addressed my physical limitations but also motivated me to push my boundaries. Their encouragement and expertise played a crucial role in my successful rehabilitation journey.
